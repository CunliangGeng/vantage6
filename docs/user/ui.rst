.. _ui:

User interface
--------------

The User Interface (UI) is a website where you can login with your vantage6
user account. Which website this is, depends on the vantage6 server you are
using. If you are using the Petronas server, go to
https://portal.petronas.vantage6.ai and login with your user account.

Using the UI should be relatively straightforward. There are buttons
that should help you e.g. create a task or change your password. If
anything is unclear, please contact us via
`Discord <https://discord.com/invite/yAyFf6Y>`__.

    :ref:`this section <install-ui>` on deploying a UI.
