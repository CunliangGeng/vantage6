Node

To install the **vantage6-node** make sure you have met the
:ref:`requirements <requirements>`. Then install the latest version:

::

   pip install vantage6

This will install the CLI in order to configure, start and stop the node. The
node software itself will be downloaded when you start the node for the first
time. See :ref:`here <use-node>` for more details on how to do that.
