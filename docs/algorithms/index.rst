Algorithm Development
=====================

This section helps you to develop MPC and FL algorithms that are compatible
with vantage6. You are **not** going to find a list of algorithms here or help
on how to use them. In the :ref:`components` the basic concepts and interface
between node and algorithm is explained. Then in the :ref:`algo-tutorial` a
FL algorithm is build from scratch.

This section is to be extended with more examples in the future.
