Node
====

The vantage6 framework consists of several components that
should be installed. Which component(s) you need depends on your use case. For
example, if you only need to communicate to an existing vantage6 server, you
don't have to install a server.

We will first detail the requirements for installing a node and/or server, and
then explain the installation process per component.

.. vantage6. The first part, :ref:`use-client`, will inform you how to interact with
.. a vantage6 server through the several types of clients that are available.


.. The :ref:`use-node` section will explain how to install a node for your
.. organization and finally, in :ref:`use-server` you will be informed how to setup
.. your own vantage6 server.
